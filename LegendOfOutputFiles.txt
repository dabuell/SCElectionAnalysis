McCormick_20161108_EXCEPTIONS.txt

(For reference: South Carolina puts all the absentee, provisional, etc.,
votes in "virtual precincts" numbered 750, 850, etc. Since these have
very different characteristics of use, I sometimes exclude those precincts
from my reporting. For example, the absentee voting at county HQ on the
iVos will show opening and closing over several days, with some votes each
day, and thus that information is not relevant to determining which iVos
just failed to work properly on Election Day.)  

This is the baseline report of the things that might have gone wrong.
First I report the total number of votes as per the 152 file (code 2900, etc.)
Then the total number of votes as per the 155 file (number of asterisks).
These numbers should be the same. They won't be the same if not all the
files were uploaded, or if test votes were left in the database, or such.

I do not use this as gospel truth of things that have gone wrong.  I use
this as the indicator of what might have gone wrong.  See the comments
two paragraphs down about multiple PEBs for opening and closing.  Often,
it seems that this happens because the PEB itself has failed.

Accounting for all the iVotronics:
I list the number of iVotronics by serial number that were in the 152 but
not the 155, or the other way around. USUALLY the ones in the 152 but
not 155 are iVotronics that recorded no votes because they were misbehaving
on Election Day.  When I create instances of classes, I usually try to fill
the class variables with dummy values so I can tell that there has been
nothing entered later.  So the 'dummy' value labels are instances in which
that serial number has never appeared elsewhere in the data.

Accounting for all the PEBs:
We have had votes not counted, in various counties, over various elections,
because poll managers opened and closed with multiple PEBs but "the second PEB"
didn't get its totals put into the master file. So I pay special attention to
iVos opened and closed with different PEBs, and I match up all the PEBs by
serial number, used for closing in the 152 file, with PEBs whose totals get
uploaded to the master, and show up in the 68A file. 

Opening and closing times:
The timestamp in the iVo doesn't actually control anything (except causing
a message to pop up every time if the time in the iVo is after the official
closing time). But there is a known bug in the software that has led to
votes not being counted. If an iVotronic is opened late, by a technician, using
a PEB that the technician has and not the precinct's PEB, then the paper
tape at the end of Election Day, when the poll manager tries to close the
iVotronic, can say "Machine not opened". In fact, the tape should say "Machine
not opened with this PEB", but it doesn't. (I have witnessed this personally.)
So it's important to know which iVotronics were opened late, and especially
which PEBs were used to open those iVotronics. 

(I'll get to the description of the line describing the iVo further down.)

Memory Card:
I pay especial attention to the collection of data from the memory cards.
In the case of McCormick, none of that got done properly, apparently.
It is not unusual to see memory cards read in multiple times.


McCormick_20161108_EventCounts.txt
McCormick_20161108_EventLogs.txt
McCormick_20161108_EventTexts.txt
The event logs provide valuable information about whether there were iVotronics
that failed or didn't work very well. I count the number of log messages, the
number by type, etc., and I pull some of the messages that indicate genuine
failure (like memory card problems) or crankiness (perhaps an excessive need
for calibration). 

McCormick_20161108_FirstLastWorking.txt
After the debacle of long lines in 2012, I added code that would tell me
how many iVos were actually collecting votes in each 15 minute period
during the day.  (Here's one place where I toss the data for the
precincts numbered 750 and above).

Not having votes in a 15 minute period could indicate light turnout, but if one
iVotronic in a precinct is not collecting votes and the others are, that could
indicate a bad iVotronic, and one can target the specific 152 record for that
to find out what the log says.


McCormick_20161108_IvosAndPcts.txt
This is one of the crucial files. I count the number of votes per iVo as
shown in the 152 and in the 155 and I compare that to the number of votes in
the 30A. This is the one that catches the problem of using multiple PEBs to
open and close, but not having the second PEB get its totals uploaded. If
the closing was successful, and the memory card data uploaded to the master,
then the vote counts will be in the 152 and 155, but not in the 30A.

By precinct, by iVo, I count the number of votes in the 152, and in the 155,
and then at the end compare that total (the 138 for Mt. Carmel before the
colon) against the 30A (the 138 after the colon, with the difference in 
parentheses. 

If there are more votes in the 30A than in the 152/155, it usually means there
is a memory card that has not been uploaded. That's a minor sin. If there are
fewer votes in the 30A, it usually means that votes in an iVo have not been
included in the official count, and that's bad.


McCormick_20161108_IvoDetail.txt
This has the detail for each iVotronic.
I will go through McCormick as an example.
(152)   : the serial number was first encountered in the 152 file. This is the
          first file I process, so this is normal.
M       : The 'M' means that the 68A shows the memory card was uploaded
0009    : The precinct in which the iVo was used.   
Y       : The serial number is present in the 152    
Y       : The serial number is present in the 155 
5102655 : The serial number    
( 154104 x 2016_11_08 06:38:41  2016_11_08 07:03:55) :
          Opened with PEB serial number 154104
          'x' means the time was not reset on Election Day, 'R' means it was
          Date and time opened, in this case 6:38AM
          Date and time of collecting the first vote, in this case 7:03AM
( 154104 2016_11_08 18:45:33  2016_11_08 19:02:57)
          Closed with PEB serial number 154104
          Closed with PEB serial number 154104
          Date and time of collecting the last vote, in this case 6:45PM
          Date and time closed, in this case 7:02PM
121, 121, 121, 0 :
          Number of votes in the 152
          Number of votes in the 155
          Number of votes in the 155 for this precinct
          Number of votes cast after closing time
(0009) : Precinct number again
(###)  : The ballot style numbers used in this iVo
[time] : The time(s) when the memory card data was collected into the master

(For the longest time, only Charleston County would put multiple precincts
in the same polling place on the same iVotronics.  I have recently seen that
Berkeley and Beaufort Counties have done this.  It messes up my counts a
little, but isn't a big deal as long as it's only a couple of counties.)


McCormick_20161108_PEBDetail.txt
This has detail information on the PEBs. As mentioned above, the big issue we
have had is with multiple PEBs used for closing and then not uploaded. So
I keep track of each PEB, whether it was used for closing ('CLO-T' for
"closing True"), whether it shows up in the 152 and/or the 68A, which
precincts, and which iVo serial numbers were associated with that PEB. 



McCormick_20161108_PctDetail.txt
This gives a check on the precincts. The first column is where the pct first
appears, which is usually the 155 except for the virtual precincts. I pick up
the number of voters and the votes collected from the 30A and then verify
against the number of votes in the 152 and 155.

There are discrepancies that show up here. For the virtual precincts, there are
usually discrepancies. It sometimes happens that a iVotronic that couldn't be
closed had its data uploaded in a different way. And I always have problems
reading the 30A files because different counties choose to put data in different
columns.  With the June primary, this was only Fairfield and Marlboro, and
life was much simpler.




McCormick_20161108_MemoryCards.txt
This file, which doesn't show up in McCormick County but does in Allendale,
lists when the memory cards from the iVos were uploaded to the master.





McCormick_20161108_BallotStyles.txt
Since I don't have access to the ballot styles from the counties, I can
only infer what they were by what votes were cast. This file isn't entirely
correct, then, because it could happen that a candidate in a ballot style
in a small jurisdiction wound up with no votes, and then wouldn't show up
at all. But this helps.

I run totals from the 155 of who got the votes:
A: by ballot style, iVotronic, precinct, candidate, and contest.
B: by iVotronic, precinct, candidate, and contest.
C: by precinct, candidate, and contest.
D: by candidate and contest.
